## Enhancement Three

As my final enhancement, I fleshed out the menus and integrated each part of the classes that I began with. A main.exe file is also included within the src folder to easily run the program as it currently is as of this version. I also restructured the files a bit since the previous version to make it easier to work with. With this version, I demonstrate my ability to create a functional, if basic, program that accepts and parses user input to manipulate class objects.
