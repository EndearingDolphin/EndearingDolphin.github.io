## Enhancement Two

The second enhancement I planned was to create a command-line menu to implement class integration within. This version of the app was refactored to have header files for each class, and the menu system and sub menu for each class was built, however the class integration is not yet imlpemented as of this version.

Because the original Java project was not to create a functional program but to learn how Junit testing is done, it was a great starting point for me to build on, and that's why I decided to use it for each enhancement. I had planned to connect the program to MongoDB as a database, but I wasn't able to get the MongoDBcxx driver to install correctly on my machine, and so I had to scrap the idea and instead integrate the classes to the best of my ability within the command line menus.
