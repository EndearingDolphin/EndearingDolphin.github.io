# Task & TaskService

The purpose of the Task class is to store data in the form of an ID, a task name and a task description. This correlates to a task as well as description of that task. The class includes functions for creating a class object with that information as well as functions to get information for each variable and set each variable within each object.

The TaskService class contains functions intended for the user to interact with the Task objects like creating and adding a new Task object into a vector for storage, displaying the stored Tasks, and updating each object's stored data.
