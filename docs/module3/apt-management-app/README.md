## Enhancement One


  The first enhancement was to convert the original Java project files into C++. The major problem I ran into during this process was simply reminding myself how C++ syntax worked, as it had been quite some time since I last coded in that particular language, but I found the process got a lot easier as I went because I started remembering how everything came together.

  As of this version, the code isn't executable, as it's only the classes themselves with no way of interacting with them.
