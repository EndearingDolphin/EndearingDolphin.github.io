# Contact & ContactService

The purpose of the Contact class is to store data in the form of an ID, a first name, a last name, a phone number, and an address. These correlate to contact information. The class includes functions for creating a class object with that information as well as functions to get information for each variable and set each variable within each object.

The ContactService class contains functions intended for the user to interact with the Contact objects like creating and adding a new Contact object into a vector for storage, displaying the stored Contacts, and updating each Contact's stored data.
