# Appointment & AppointmentService

The purpose of the Appointment class is to store data in the form of an ID, a date and a description. This correlates to an appointment as well as description of that appointment. The class includes functions for creating a class object with that information as well as functions to get information for each variable and set each variable within each object.

The AppointmentService class contains functions intended for the user to interact with the Appointment objects like creating and adding a new Appointment object into a vector for storage, displaying the stored Appointments, and updating each object's stored data.
