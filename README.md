#### **Welcome to my Github portfolio, my name is Justin.**

  As my time in the SNHU Computer Science program nears its' conclusion, I find myself somewhat nostalgic for the early days of the program when I was just getting into coding and starting to learn the basics. 

  My biggest regret perhaps is the fact that I didn't go out of my way to absorb and learn as much as I possibly could early on. The past year I've tried to take it much more seriously in order to finish up my degree and get started on building myself a proper life and career where I can contribute something of value. As my skills grew, and also stagnated at times, I learned many things during the course of this program and also got stuck in many places with certain aspects of not just developing code, but also designing programs and testing them. 

  One of my classes involved creating a text-based adventure game written in Python. It was a simple premise but I learned a lot about how Python worked at the time, including that it's my favorite language to work with due to the ease of development and the syntax being very easy to understand. Within that game I included several items the player needed to pick up in order to defeat the final boss, but I mistakenly only checked the number of items the player had when they got to that point, resulting in an amusing bug that my professor found where you could simply pick up the same item a number of times and you'd still win the game.

  I've got a decent grasp of the fundamentals of coding thanks to the CS program, but I've struggled to retain certain more complicated information from some courses due to them only coming up during those single classes. My experience with algorithms especially is on the lighter side, but I'm confident in my learning capabilities when I focus and put my mind to it. I have a decent amounnt of experience collaborating with others in different situations, but not specifically on a coding project, so I look forwards to gaining that experience as well. As for security, I have the top most knowledge of how to prevent certain common vulnerabilities within a program as well as standards in order to keep code secure.

### [The Artifact](https://github.com/EndearingDolphin/endearingdolphin.github.io/tree/main/original%20java%20project%20files)
  With all that being said, let me move onto the artifact I chose to enhance for my CS-499 capstone course. It comes from my CS-320 class, in which the final project was to create six different classes: a Contact class, ContactService class, Task class, TaskService class, Appointment class, and AppointmentService class. The project was originally written in Java.

Below are links to each enhancement and their accompanying narrative.
